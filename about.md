<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<br>
We came together in 2014 to save Glamis Residents' Hall and its services from closure.  
We became a registered charity (No. 1148565) in early 20xx to help us provide services at Glamis Residents' Hall for the community.
<br><br>

<h3>What is the Glamis Residents' Hall?</h3>
<br>
Glamis Residents' Hall is a large square room (169 sq m), with a separate foyer, high ceilings, ceiling mounted glitter-ball, LED disco lights, a small stage, a bar area (with pub style fridge and large catering fridge and separate small chest freezer), a separate kitchenette/food preparation area, and ladies/gents toilets.
The hall is fully disabled accessible. Parking on-street only.
