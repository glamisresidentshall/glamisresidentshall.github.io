<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<br>
The Glamis Residents' Association became a registered charity (No. 1148565) in late 2012 to making the Glamis Estate and surrounding areas a vibrant, welcoming, and supportive community for everyone.
<br><br>

<h3>What is the Glamis Residents' Hall?</h3>
<br>
Glamis Residents' Hall is a large square room (169 sq m), with a separate foyer, high ceilings, ceiling mounted glitter-ball, LED disco lights, a small stage, a bar area (with pub style fridge and large catering fridge and separate small chest freezer), a separate kitchenette/food preparation area, and ladies/gents toilets.
The hall is fully disabled accessible. Parking on-street only.

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<br>
We strive to:
<br>

- **Bring people together:** We work with residents, local organizations, and authorities to create opportunities for connection, collaboration, and shared experiences.
  
- **Enhance well-being:** By offering educational programs, recreational activities, and social events, we aim to improve the quality of life for everyone in our community.
  
- **Provide a community hub:** The Glamis Residentsâ€™ Hall serves as a central space for events, gatherings, and initiatives that support the needs and aspirations of local people.
  
- **Support inclusivity:** We welcome everyone, regardless of age, background, or beliefs, and are committed to fostering a space that celebrates diversity.
  
- **Promote charitable efforts:** We also support other meaningful causes that benefit the community.

As a non-political and non-religious organization, our goal is to create a space where everyone feels they belong and can thrive.
